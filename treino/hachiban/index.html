                    There’s an old saying, that ‘clothes make the man.’ At <a href="https://anilist.co/anime/18679/Kill-la-Kill/" target="_blank" class="externo">Honnouji Academy ✭></a> , however, clothes make more than just the man… They make the warrior, they make the authority, and they separate the powerful from the weak. You see, at this school, classes are more than just those things you struggle to stay awake through while fantasizing about the dreamy classmate a few seats over… They’re the things you’re bound by, as part of an ironclad caste system. Depending on your level in that caste system, you may or may not be given a Goku uniform, which are special school uniforms that amplify the natural abilities and club-related interests of their respective wearers. The more powerful the uniform, the more stars you’re granted, from one to three… With the very top position occupied by the stone-faced, cold-hearted <strong>Satsuki Kiryuin</strong>, the Student Council President who runs the school as if it’s her own personal dictatorship. She lords over her school, which itself lords over the town, with no living being opposing her rule.

With a unique sentient Goku uniform named <strong>Senketsu</strong> by her side, a hyperactive best friend giving her a place to stay, and a shady teacher constantly trying to convince her to get naked(for surprisingly non-rapey reasons), will this loudmouthed punk have what it takes to raze Satsuki’s rubric regime, or is she facing a literal uphill battle that she can’t possibly win?
                    For those of you who haven’t read my April reviews, I like to describe Studio Gainax’s animation quality as being ‘inconsistent.’ Considering how abundant this problem is, I would expect the same from any animation studio that could ever spin off from Gainax… And yet, Studio Trigger has proven me wrong. Trigger was founded by two of Gainax’s former members, Hiroyuki Imaishi and Masahiko Ohtsuka, as they left the company in 2011. Yes, this studio is only four years old, with only a few titles under their belt, and yet they produced one of the most unique visual wonders of that time period

                    I have never seen an anime that looked quite like Kill La Kill before. It seems to take the fast paced frenetic action of Gurren Lagann and combine it with the smooth, western character and art design of Panty and Stocking, effectively taking the best aspects of both shows while cancelling out the ugly shortcuts that originally plagued them. This makes it look more like a Looney Toons project than anything you’d naturally expect from the anime medium. Only, you know, with boobs instead of rabbits. It completely avoids the awkward frame rate drops that normally occur whenever the action speeds up in a Gainax show, and which is normally my biggest complaint about their animation, managing to look smooth even through it’s more demanding shots.

                    Of course, whether it’s able to do this because they have a relatively high budget or because they’re extremely good at managing an average budget, I honestly can’t tell. It uses a lot of your classic moneysaving shortcuts, such as items and people moving as though they’ve just been cut out of the screen via photoshop, but they’re used so deliberately and so stylistically that it’s difficult to tell whether or not it was ever done out of necessity. Even when the characters have been reduced to frozen talking heads, there will almost always be something else moving on screen, whether it’s the clouds in the background, someone’s hair in the wind, or even just the design on their uniform. This is a really good line to blur, and it keeps up really well with the breakneck pace of the series.

                        She transfers into Honnouji Academy as a second-year student, an Academy ruled by power and authority. She wields a huge single-bladed scissor, and demands to know the owner of the other half. As she remembers, the wielder of the lost half of the scissor blade is the same person who killed her father.
